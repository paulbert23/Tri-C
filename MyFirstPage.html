<h1>pfSense Build 2022</h1>

<p>I would like to build a router, to run the software  <a href="https://www.pfsense.org/about-pfsense/" target="_blank">pfSense</a> , which is a free, open source 
customized distribution of FreeBSD specifically tailored for use as a firewall and router. You can buy pre-made hardware 
from <a href="https://www.netgate.com/pfsense-plus-software/how-to-buy#appliances" target="_blank">Netgate</a> that comes with 
pfSense pre-installed, but I enjoy building computers.  Also, they have recently come out with pfSense+, which is not fully open source. If you buy Netgate hardware, 
as far as I can understand, you have to use pfSense+ and cannot use the Community Edition.  This probably is not a big deal, but I like the idea of open source and 
building my own hardware.  Here is my <a href="https://pcpartpicker.com/user/psnwboard/saved/JQHzP6" target="_blank">parts list</a> for how I would like to build the router.  The focus is mostly on low wattage, since this would be an always-on machine. 
Prices are fairly high right now, so this isn't a project that is happening any time soon.</p>
