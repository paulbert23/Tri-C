My first Repository

My name is Paul Albert.

Here is a list, and description of my files.

*main.pw* <br>The purpose of this file is to practice the fundamentals of classes and objects in Python.

*SQLProductsByPrice.png*<br>Demonstrates the correct SQL statement for a business to use to find out what their most expensive products are in SQL. The statement orders all of the products by price, in descending order.

*SQLProductsGT25.png*<br>Demonstrates the correct SQL statement for a business to use to make a list of products that cost more than $25.  The output shows the product name, units, and price, in ascending order by price.

This diagram demonstrates the star topology, with all of the hard wired hosts and the wireless access point all connecting directly to one switch.  This network diagram includes a modem, firewall, router, switch, wireless access point, computers, printer, tv, cellphone, and laptop.
